# L20n For Games

## Version 2

Mozilla started pushing L20n (for the web) once again. With it, they have a new (in flux) language. One that's simpler than ever and easier to use.
In fact one could at it simplest see it as a good-old-fashioned key-value document, as many games tend to use.

In this version I also  to keep the L20n For Games spec, as a subset of the latest possible L20n specification.
You can find the specification now as [a EBNF grammer file](https://github.com/GlenDC/l20n-mozilla-spec/blob/master/grammar.ebnf).
That is to say that it should always be possible to parse and use a pure l20n file, as anything different is added, rather than removed.

[Extended Backus-Naur Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_form) (ENBF) is a notation used to express a context-free gammer,
a type of grammar used to describe formal languages, such as a computer language.

This version is for now the default version, but can also be explicitly specified in your manifest file as `l20n`.
